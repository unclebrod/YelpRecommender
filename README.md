# Yelp Recommender: Restaurants in Charlotte
The goal of this project was to build an explicit recommender system using collaborative filtering for restaurants in Charlotte using [Yelp's Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). I wanted to explore the mechanics of recommendations systems, and explore a new library in [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com).

# Technologies
* Python (including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Surprise)
* Amazon EC2

# Looking Forward
I consider this project foundational in my understanding and implementation of recommender systems. Looking forward, here are some things I'd like to explore:
* Creating user interactivity, either through a self-contained Python class and/or a Flask app
* Further researching ways to handle skewed, non-evenly distributed data
* Adjusting the recommendation system to ensure that there's serendipity and variety, and that smaller businesses with fewer reviews are represented
* Building a hybrid recommender that also takes into account the text content of reviews

A big thanks to Dan Rupp, Juliana Duncan, Peter Galea, and Austin Penner, each of whom poured a lot of their time and energy in helping me complete this project. Thanks to [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) for making their dataset available. Additionally, several publications helped me in understanding the theory behind recommenders and test metrics:
